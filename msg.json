    "Hi there!\n\nI'm happy to help! When you say \"give in give points,\" could you tell me a little more about what you're looking for?\n\nFor example, do you mean:\n*   **Give me information in bullet points?** If so, what topic would you like the points on?\n*   **Explain what it means to \"give points\"** in a discussion or debate (i.e., acknowledging a valid argument)?\n*   **\"Give in\" as in to yield or surrender**, and \"give points\" as in to concede arguments?\n\nOnce I understand what you're looking for, I can provide the best possible answer!",
